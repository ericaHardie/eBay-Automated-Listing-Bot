3. **Output or Action** — The automation posts listings to eBay, optimizes titles, and syncs status with inventory systems.  
4. **Error Handling** — Built-in retry logic and logging ensure smooth execution and automatic recovery from network or app issues.  
5. **Monitoring & Reporting** — Dashboard displays logs, execution stats, and listing summaries in real-time.
